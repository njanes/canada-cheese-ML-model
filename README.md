# Predictive Machine Learning: Classifying the Canadian Cheese Directory
A predictive machine learning model for the classification of Canadian cheeses

## Introduction:
The Jupyter notebook documents the development of a supervised machine learning model for the classification of cheese produced in Canada. The objective is for the model to successfully predict whether a cheese is lower-fat or higher-fat, given data on the cheese's milk type and moisture content. This model aims to provide value to cheese producers, distributors, and retailers in labeling cheeses correctly to allow for more efficient development of marketing strategies and better catering to consumer preferences and dietary needs.
